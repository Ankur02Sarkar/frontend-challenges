## Use Cases

- Employers evaluating frontend developer skills
- Frontend developers seeking practice with coding challenges.

## Getting Started

If you wanna work with React, you can use the starter template.

you can create a new project by using the create_project script:

```bash

# Example 1
source scripts/create_project.sh $PROJECT_NAME

# Example 2
source scripts/create_project.sh $PROJECT_NAME $PROJECT_PATH

# $PROJECT_PATH default value is 'problems'
```

## How to Check if Your Solution (UI) Is Accessible

- Test your app with a keyboard to ensure full keyboard navigation
- Add ARIA labels to make your app understandable by screen readers
- Use [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/index/claude) for a final accessibility check

You can use automated accessibility checkers like **axe-core** to detect most accessibility issues.

For more information, check out [this article](https://larsmagnus.co/blog/how-to-test-for-accessibility-with-axe-core-in-next-js-and-react).

> [!NOTE]  
> axe-core is already included in the starter template.
