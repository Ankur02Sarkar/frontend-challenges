## Use Cases

- Employers evaluating frontend developer skills
- Frontend developers seeking practice with coding challenges.

## Getting Started

If you wanna work with React, you can use the starter template.

you can create a new project by using the create_project script:

```bash

# Example 1
source scripts/create_project.sh $PROJECT_NAME

# Example 2
source scripts/create_project.sh $PROJECT_NAME $PROJECT_PATH

# $PROJECT_PATH default value is 'problems'
```

## How to check if your solution (UI) is accessible

You can use automated accessibility checkers like **axe-core** to detect most accessibility issues.
