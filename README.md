## Use Cases

- Employers evaluating frontend developer skills
- Frontend developers seeking practice with coding challenges.

## Getting Started

If you wanna work with React, you can use the starter template.

you can create a new project by using the create_project script:

```bash
sh scripts/create_project.sh $PROJECT_NAME
sh scripts/create_project.sh $PROJECT_NAME $PROJECT_PATH

# $PROJECT_PATH default value is 'problems'
```

## How to check if your solution is accessible

You can use automated accessibility checkers like **axe-core** to detect most accessibility issues.
