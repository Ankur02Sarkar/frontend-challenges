<!-- placeholder img -->

## Problem Description

Create a simulated traffic light. The traffic light should cycle through red, yellow, and green lights automatically, mimicking the behavior of a real traffic signal.

## Requirements

The game should have a grid of 9 holes.
When the game starts, a mole will pop up randomly from one of the holes.
The player must click on the mole to whack it. When the player whacks the mole, they will get a point.
If the player does not whack the mole within 1.5 seconds, the mole will disappear.
The next mole randomly appears from one of the holes and the process repeats.
The player has 15 seconds to hit as many moles as possible.
The game ends when the timer runs out, the score is displayed and the player has the option to play again.
