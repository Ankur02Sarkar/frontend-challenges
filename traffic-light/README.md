## Problem Description
Create a simulated traffic light. The traffic light should cycle through red, yellow, and green lights automatically, mimicking the behavior of a real traffic signal.

## Requirements
1. Display three lights: red, yellow, and green.
2. Automatically cycle through the lights in the correct order (red -> green -> yellow -> red).
3. Each light should stay active for a set duration:
   - Red: 4 seconds
   - Green: 3 seconds
   - Yellow: 1 second
4. Only one light should be active at a time.
5. The cycle should repeat indefinitely.

## Solution
A sample solution is provided in `TrafficLight.jsx`. Try implementing your own solution before looking at this!
