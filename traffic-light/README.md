# Traffic Light Challenge

## Problem Description
Create a simulated traffic light. The traffic light should cycle through red, yellow, and green lights automatically, mimicking the behavior of a real traffic signal.

## Requirements
1. Display three lights: red, yellow, and green.
2. Automatically cycle through the lights in the correct order (red -> green -> yellow -> red).
3. Each light should stay active for a set duration:
   - Red: 4 seconds
   - Green: 3 seconds
   - Yellow: 1 second
4. Only one light should be active (illuminated) at a time.
5. The cycle should repeat indefinitely.

## Bonus Features (Optional)
- Add a button to manually change the light.
- Implement accessibility features (e.g., aria labels, keyboard controls).
- Add sound effects for each light change.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `traffic-light` directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Use `npm start` to run the development server.

## Solution
A sample solution is provided in `TrafficLight.jsx`. Try implementing your own solution before looking at this!

## Evaluation Criteria
- Correct functionality
- Code cleanliness and organization
- Use of React hooks and state management
- Styling and visual appeal
- Bonus points for additional features or accessibility considerations

Good luck!
